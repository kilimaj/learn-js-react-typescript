    <h2>Promises</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.</li>
        <li>An asynchronous operation is a type of operation that doesn't block the program's execution and allows other code to run while it's being processed.</li>
        <li>Promises can be used to handle the results of asynchronous operation, such as network request or a file read, that take some time to complete</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Promises 3 states</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pending - starts in a pending state</li>
        <li>Fulfilled - if the asynchronous operation succeeds</li>
        <li>Rejected - if the asynchronous operation fails</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous results in a manageable and predictable manner.</p>

    <h2>Async Await keywords</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Async keyword is used to create asynchronous functions in JS</li>
        <li>When you declare a function with async keyword you can use the await keyword inside the function to wait for the results of an asynchronous operation</li>
    </ul>
